# website-project

This was the project that I created in my last year of high school that was submitted as my coursework. It is a fairly simple website built using php and sql to allow users to submit, read and search for reviews of programming languages made by other users. These reviews were stored in a database which was queried with sql to either add a review, read through all the reviews that are stored, or to search for a specific type of review. The website did force users to sign up and login to an account in order to do any of the above, otherwise there would be a message informing them that they needed to login.

# other info

This website was entirely my own work, putting together all my knowledge at the time (2021 - 2022) on the subjects.
